# AllSpeak — Language Enhancement TODO

Items identified during real project work. Each should be implemented in both JS and Python.

## High priority

### 1. ~~String split by delimiter~~ ✓ Done
Implemented in both JS and Python. The `split` command now accepts `by` in addition to `on`:
```
split MessageText by `|` into Parts
put element 0 of Parts into TopicName
```
New value expression for single-field extraction:
```
put field 0 of MessageText delimited by `|` into TopicName
```

### 2. ~~Append to JSON array in file~~ ✓ Done (Python only)
Implemented in Python. Creates `[]` if the file doesn't exist. Supports `or` error handling.

```
append `{"name":"test"}` to json file `data/topics.json`
```
JS not applicable — browser file writes use `rest post` to a server; the existing in-memory `append` command covers the JS use case.

## Medium priority

### 3. Storage get with defaults
`get X from storage` returns the string `"null"` or `"undefined"` when a key is missing, requiring repeated cleanup. Should return empty instead, or support a fallback:

**Proposed syntax:**
```
get Broker from storage as `chat-broker` or clear
```

### 4. Multi-field unpack with remainder
For protocols using delimited fields where the last field may contain the delimiter:

**Proposed syntax:**
```
unpack MessageText by `|` into TopicName Subject Author Body
```
Last variable gets the remainder.

## Housekeeping (not language work)

### 5. Prune `resources/ecs` — scheduled, not yet done

`resources/ecs/` is a **superseded site generation**. `documents/doclets-feature-checklist.md`
already records the reason: the deploy pipeline never ships it (`deploy-allspeak` mirrors only
`codex/`, `learn/`, `primer/`). What remains is a mixture of ages and purposes, which is the
argument for pruning it rather than keeping it as one unit:

- **18 files dated 2026-04-06** (the fork day) — the old site's pages.
- `scripted.as` / `scripted-server.as` / `scripted.html` / `scripted.json` / `README.md`
  (04-08) — the self-contained "scripted" colour-coded editor, a five-file bundle described in
  `resources/ecs/README.md`, which now sits among unrelated pages.
- `docman.as` (04-17), `doclets.as` (08-04), `main.as` (08-19) — the more recent page work.

Renaming the folder is not worth doing on its own: if it is pruned, the name goes with it; if a
subset survives, name it after what it is (`scripted/`).

**Clear these first — each is a reference the prune would leave dangling:**

1. `project.html:13` loads `/resources/ecs/project-main.as`, which does not exist. Fix or retire
   `project.html`.
2. `codex/{en,de,fr,it}/md/tools.md` use `/resources/ecs/myscript.as` as an example path. Repoint
   to a path that exists.
3. The four `resources/doc/*/core.json` translation caches link to `resources/ecs/sample/factory`,
   which does not exist. Repoint or drop the links.
4. `index.html:21` and `codex/codex.as:303` load `main.as` and `docman.as` from the folder. Decide
   whether those entry points survive.
5. `resources/ecs/README.md` describes a five-file bundle but sits in a folder of unrelated pages.
   Move the `scripted*` files out together with their README, or drop them.

**Why nothing can be lost:** all 33 files under `resources/ecs/` are tracked, so any of them is
recoverable with `git log -- resources/ecs/<file>` after deletion. Run `./deploy-sync` afterwards,
because `deploy/` holds a mirror of the tree.

**When:** together with the `resources/` prune as a whole — not during a deploy freeze, and not
with a release in flight.


## Language packs

### 6. The `viz` marker's option words — decided; pending native review

`viz` is core syntax (a no-op command) with the grammar
`viz start|stop [on <label>] [once|every] [until thread] [limit <count>]`. Every option
word now has a local spelling in all four packs, so a marker can be written entirely in the
local language — verified by compiling each of these to the same internal marker
(`request=start, mode=once, until=thread, limit=2`):

    fr   viz démarre une-fois jusqu'à fil limite 2      viz arrête
    it   viz avvia una-volta fino-a discussione limite 2   viz ferma
    de   viz starte einmal bis Thread Limit 2            viz stoppe

`viz` itself stays `viz` in all four languages, as `json` and `mqtt` do: technical keywords
are not translated.

| canonical | en | fr | it | de |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `on` | on | sur | su | bei |
| `start` / `stop` | start / stop | démarre / arrête | avvia / ferma | starte / stoppe |
| `every` | every | chaque | ogni | jede |
| `once` | once | une-fois *(provisional)* | una-volta *(provisional)* | einmal |
| `limit` | limit | limite | limite | Limit\|limit |
| `until` | until | jusqu'à † | fino-a | bis |
| `thread` | thread | fil | discussione\|thread | Thread\|thread |

† Four spellings — `jusqu'à|jusqu’à|jusqu'a|jusqu’a` — because the match is exact and a
French writer chooses the apostrophe (ASCII or typographic) and the accent independently.
Verified end to end. This is the first apostrophe in any of the four packs.

**Constraints a local word must satisfy** (learned the hard way, worth keeping for any
future vocabulary):
- **One token.** The tokeniser splits on whitespace and `reverse_word` is a whole-token
  lookup, so a phrase can never match: `une fois` is two tokens and no entry can bind it.
  The failure is loud rather than silent — `viz start une fois` stops with
  `Je ne comprends pas 'une'` — but it is still a failure. Hyphens and apostrophes are fine
  inside a word, which is what makes `une-fois`, `una-volta`, `fino-a` and `jusqu'à` work.
  This is also why the label form is `on <label>`: `une` and `una` on their own are already
  the article (`an`), and `on` needed no new word at all.
- **Case matters.** The lookup is exact and every existing German keyword is lowercase
  (`körper`, `nachricht`, `zahl`), so the correct German noun spellings — `Limit`, `Thread` —
  are entered as `Limit|limit` and `Thread|thread`, keeping the proper spelling canonical
  without making them the only keywords a German script must capitalise.

**For the native reviewers:** the French and Italian `once` forms are provisional guesses
(`une-fois`, `una-volta`); Italian `discussione` is the forum-thread sense, whereas the
marker means a thread of execution, so `thread` may be the better primary there; and the
German capitalisation call (`Limit`/`Thread` first, or lowercase-first) is a matter of taste.

**One follow-up.** `tools/generate-translated-docs.py` reads this same `words` table and
substitutes word by word (`words[tok].split('|')`, line 107), and the English doc source in
`resources/doc/en` contains the new words — `once` 4 times, `thread` 3, `until` 5 — so the
next doc regeneration will change some French/Italian/German lines. That is mostly what you
want for syntax lines, but the substitution is word-level and will also touch prose
containing those words. Worth eyeballing those diffs before the next `deploy-sync`.

### 7. `modifyValue` is still undocumented in the plugin contract

`as_value.py` calls `domain.modifyValue(value)` on every registered domain, and the JS twin
of that bug was fixed earlier by guarding `handler.value`. Any plugin domain must define
`modifyValue` to avoid an AttributeError; `spec/allspeak-plugin-contract.md` does not say so.
